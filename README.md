# BHMV
Blockchain-based Healthcare Management System with Two-side Verifiability (BHMV) is a project that I have been working on for the past year as my final year project. BHMV sets to provide a safe and efficient scheme for sharing the electronic health records safely across different networks and platforms regardless of the cloud service provider.
